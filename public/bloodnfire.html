								<div class="caption">There are approximately 3.5 million homeless people in America, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless.  Of those 3.5 million at least 20,000 people on any given night seek refuge in the shelters of Atlanta, Georgia.  Having one of the highest rates of urban poor in the US, Atlanta has more children living in poverty than any other city in America.  Situated in the heart of the city, Blood-n-Fire Ministries of Atlanta seeks to outreach to this disadvantaged population by providing them with basic needs, prayer, and above all community. Though the Blood-n-Fire shelter closed in 2005, it used to be known as the “Sanctuary” because it strove to be a place of safety and rest and not just a physical shelter.  Situated on 3.7 acres of industrial land, the Sanctuary was a converted warehouse that served over 300 people daily. People not just slept under the same roof, but worshiped together, played together and ate together, trying to provide for one another the community and relationship that the empty streets so lacked.  The missionaries that worked at the Sanctuary used whatever skills they had to empower the people who sought shelter whether it was mentoring, educating or even giving haircuts.  The shelter closed due to lack of funding.  But, Blood-n-Fire Atlanta still remains very much alive as a community of worship and currently runs a permanent provisional environment for elderly homeless men and women know as the Glenwood Community House.</div>
