								<div class="caption">Hocking Valley Community Residential Center, located in Nelsonville, Ohio, acts as a temporary home to non-violent felony offending youth.  With ages ranging from 13-18, the H.V.C.R.C is a court ordered disciplinary program that stresses structure and responsibility that the offender lacked in his previous environment. Built in a non-traditional manner, the center tries to stray from a prison-like atmosphere and relies on innovative programs in order to educate and instill discipline in juveniles of 13 counties in the Southeast Ohio Region.  For some youth, this program is a preventive measure in order to keep the youth from further involvement with the juvenile court system.  For others, H.V.C.R.C is the last chance of reform until sent to Detention Youth Services known to the juveniles as “lock up”.</div>
