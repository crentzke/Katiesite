								<div class="caption">Work in Progress<br><br>Manenberg is a township situated on the outskirts of Cape Town South Africa in an area referred to as the “Cape Flats”.  Established in 1966 during Apartheid, Manenberg was labeled as a “non-white area” and created to house a forcefully displaced Coloured community under what was known as the Group Areas Act.  The Coloured population is one unique to Southern Africa. A mixed race that stems from a combination of Caucasian, African and imported Malaysian slaves, they speak mainly Afrikaans, and over time have formed their own unique culture, different from both the white and black cultures that coexist in South Africa. Manenberg has a reputation for high levels of gang warfare, overpopulation and poverty. Despite such marginalization, the community has a strong sense of culture, and is a resilient population. They continually strive to take back their community, trying to provide a neighborhood that they have created for themselves instead of one that the old Apartheid Government dictated to them.</div>
